#  Unit Converter

A Python-based unit conversion tool that handles common transformations in physics and everyday calculations — temperature, mass, length, and time. Built with precision and an 
interdisciplinary approach that blends scientific logic with practical Python coding.


# Features

- ✅ Temperature conversions: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
- ✅ Mass conversions: Kilograms, Pounds, Grams
- ✅ Length conversions: Meters, Inches, Feet
- ✅ Time conversions: Seconds, Minutes, Hours


## 🧪 Sample Usage

```python
convert("celsius", "fahrenheit", 100)  # ➡ 212.0
convert("kilogram", "pound", 2)        # ➡ 4.409

#📐 Physics Behind the Conversions

Each transformation follows real-world formulas:

- F = C × 9/5 + 32
- 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs
- 1 m = 39.3701 in

The logic is modular, making it easy to scale or adapt to new units later.
